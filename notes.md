- _Rasterization_: process of finding 2D pixel coordinates of 3D points
  - Can also do ray tracing
- _Raster image_: 2D array of pixels
- To create an image,
  - Extend lines from vertices towards eye
  - Find intersection of lines with "canvas" that is perpendicular to line of sight
- Compute world coordinates of point in front of camera
  - Can be done with simple point-matrix multiplication
  - This is also called the _perspective projection matrix_
  - [Lesson](lesson) teaches how to compute coordinates without perspective projection matrix
- Foreshortening
  - Objects angled towards the viewer appear smaller
- _World space_; has a _world origin_
- 4x4 matrix represents a Cartesian coordinate system (and vice versa)
  - Other coordinate systems are defined with respect to the world coordinate system
    - We can call these "local" coordinate systems
  - We can interpret the top-left 3x3 matrix as the x-, y-, and z- axes.
- We can visualize a transformation matrix as transforming a coordinate system
- Transform between world and local spaces
  - `P(world) = P(local) * M`
  - `P(local) = P(world) * M(inverse)`
